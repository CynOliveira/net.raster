The objective of net.raster is to calculate spatialized interaction network metrics for bipartite networks, using species presence-absence rasters as input, in addition to the interaction matrix. net.raster enhances the visualization of interaction patterns in space, enabling another layer beyond species distribution models (SDM). 

## Installation
